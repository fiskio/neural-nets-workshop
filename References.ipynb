    "\n",
    "- [Torch Homepage](www.torch.ch) This is the starting point to access the Torch galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular you'll find a lot of very useful information in:\n",
    "   - [Torch Tensor](https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/doc/tensor.md) Everything you wanted to know about tensors, and then some more!\n",
    "   - [Torch Math Functions](https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/doc/maths.md) All the mathematical operation you can do on tensors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Also, some othe nice Torch resources are:\n",
    "   - [Neural Network Package](https://github.com/torch/nn)  Contains the official Torch neural network modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet) A lot of Torch related resource, incredibly useful!\n",
